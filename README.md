## 🧪 Example Prompts for AI

```txt
- Suggest an outfit for a rainy day in Mumbai.
- What can I wear with a black leather jacket and sneakers?
- Best formal outfit ideas for men with chinos.
- Outfit tips for a summer wedding guest.
```

## ✏️ How to Add Clothes (with Prompt)
To add a clothing item, enter its description in the text box. You can be as descriptive or minimal as you'd like.

```csharp

Red cotton t-shirt
Denim jeans with ripped knees
Formal black blazer for office wear
White sneakers with red accents
```
This helps AI give more context-aware suggestions. More detailed prompts = smarter outfit ideas!

## 🆕 Delete Outfit Feature

You can now click the ❌ icon next to each outfit item in the list to delete it.

```jsx
<li key={index}>
  {outfit}
  <button onClick={() => handleDelete(index)}>❌</button>
</li>
```

This updates your state and removes the selected outfit from the list instantly.
